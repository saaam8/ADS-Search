## Summary

ADS-Search is an adaptive and modular search algorithm optimized for 2D/3D/4D datasets. It integrates division-based data segmentation with dual-direction steering logic and real-time feedback evaluation. The algorithm adapts scan behavior based on region-specific characteristics, using ascending/descending patterns and horizontal/vertical directions. It is tested on datasets exceeding 10 million points and includes benchmarking scripts and open-source implementations. ADS-Search aims to improve search p...
